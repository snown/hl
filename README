### Functionality
Will take path arguments and create hardlinks between them, including the folder/directory hierarchy. The last argument is assumed to be the destination. 

### Disclaimer
This is intended for my personal use. This is far from optimized, and there may be better ways to accomplish these tasks. If you have suggestions I am happy to read them and consider implementation. My hope is that this will help get someone started if they are looking to accomplish a similar task.
